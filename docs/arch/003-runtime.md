# 3. Runtime

Date: 2020-09-21

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We want to build a serverless application with a function that
returns a `"Hello World!"` message. We need to pick a programming
language.

## Decision

We will use [Python3.8]

## Consequences

**Pros:**

* It's my favourite!
* It is easy to learn and easy to read
* It is well suited to AWS Lambda (due to short start-up time)
* It has a strong community

**Cons:**

* It can be slow (compared to some other languages)
